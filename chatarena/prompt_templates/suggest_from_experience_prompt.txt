I retrieve some historical experience similar to current situation that I am facing. There is one bad experience: {G0} And there are also a set of experience that may consist of good ones: {G1, · · · ,Gn} Please help me analyze the differences between these experiences and identify the good ones from the set of experiences. The difference is mainly about voting to kill someone or to pass, choosing to protect someone or to pass, using drugs or not. What does the experience set do but the bad experience does not do? Indicate in second person what is the best way for the player to do under such reflection. Clearly indicate whether to vote, protect or use drugs without any prerequisites. 

Example 1: The experience set involves choosing to protect someone, while the bad experience involves not protecting anyone and choosing to pass in contrast. The best way for you to do under such reflection is to choose someone to protect based on your analysis. 

Example 2: The bad experience choose to pass the voting, and all the experience in the experience set choose to pass as well. The best way for you to do under such reflection is to observe and analyse the identity of other players. No more than 1 sentence. If there is no obvious difference between them, only generate “No useful experience can be used."
