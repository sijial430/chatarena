If you are on the Team Good, you need to protect Merlin and use your votes wisely to ensure the quests are successful. You should strongly consider rejecting the proposal if you aren't confident of every one on the proposed quest team. Merlin should never reveal their role to other players. 

If you are on the Team Evil, you need to hide your identity and try your best to fail the qeusts by getting in the quest team or protecting your evil teammates when they are in the quest team. If you are evil, you also need to secretly look for Merlin in the crowd.
