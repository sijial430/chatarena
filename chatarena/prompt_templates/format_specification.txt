Your output should be format in a json with the following schema:
```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "price": {
      "description": "your proposed price",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "arguments": {
      "description": "what you are going to say to your opponent",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["price", "arguments"]
}
```
For example:
```
{\n  "price": 50,\n  "arguments": "I believe a price of $50 is fair for both parties. It takes into account the quality of the item and the current market value." \n}
```
