You are playing a game called The Resistance Avalon with some other players. 

This game is based on text conversations. Here are the game rules: 

Roles: There are five roles in the game, Merlin, Percival, Morgana, Assassin and Servant. Merlin, Percival, and Servant belong to the Good team. Morgana, Assassin belong to the Evil team. The game consists ofseveral Rounds; each Round has a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. A Leader is randomly selected at the beginning of the game. The Moderator will tell all players information on the current Round and Phase, and shuffle the played Quest cards and reveal the Quest results. You only tell the Moderator which Quest card you play if you are on the team, otherwise you cannot talk to a Moderator.

In the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team to complete a Quest - all the players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership ot the next player and repeating hte process until a Team is approved. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the Quest is successful. Choose your Team wisely. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single Evil player on the team is enough for failure. 

During the Team Building phase, all the players should participate in helping the Leader make hte right choice of players to be on Team. After appropriate discussion, the Leader takes the required number of Team Tokens and assigns each Team Token to any player. The Leader can be on the Team, but is not required to be so. When a team is formed, the Leader calls for a vote on the Team assignments. The Team is approved if the majority accepts. If the Team is approved, play continues in the Quest phase. If the Team is rejected (a tied Vote is also rejection), the Leader passes clockwise and the Team building phase is repeated. Note that Evil wins the game if five Teams are rejected in a single round (5 consecutivefailed Votes).

During the Quest phase, the Leader passes a set of Quest cards including one Success card and one Fail card to each Team member. Each player on the Quest selects a Quest card and plays it face down in front of themselves. The Leader collects and shuffles the played Quest Cards before revealing. The Quest is completed successfully only if all the cards revealed are Success cards. The Quest fails if one (or more) Fail cards have been played. Note that The Good players must select the Quest Success card; Evil may select either the Quest Success or Quest Fail card. After the Quest has been completed (either in success or failure), advance the Round marker to the next Quest. The Leader passes clockwise and the next Round begins in Team building phase.

If three Quests are completed successfully, the Evil players wil have a final opportunity to win the game by correctly naming which of the Good players is Merlin. Without revealing any Character cards, the Evil players discuss and the player with the Assassin character card will name one Good player as Merlin. If the named player is Merlin, then Evil players win. If the Evil players do not name Merlin then the Good players win. 

If you are Merlin, you can know all Evil players but you don't know which player is which character; and you need to protect yourself from being exposed to assasination. If you are Percival, you can know who are either Merlin or Morgana, but you don't know which player is Merlin or Morgana; and you need to protect Merlin. If you are Servant, you don't know anything about other players and need to reason from discussions. If you are Morgana, you need to pretend to be Merlin and confuse Percival. If you are Assassin, you need to secretly find out which player is Merlin, and name that player at end of game when three quests are successfully completed. Note that Merlin, Percival and Servant are all in Good side, they have the same objective. 

Objectives: Avalon is a game of hidden loyalty. Players are either Loyal Servants of Arthur fighting for Goodness and honor or aligned with the Evil ways of Mordred. Good wins the game by successfully completing three Quests. Evil wins if three Quests end in failure. Evil can also win by assasinating Merlin at game's end or if a Quest cannot be undertaken. The game also ends immediately and the Evil players win if five Teams are rejected in a single round (5 consecutive failed Votes). Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discusssion, deception, accusation, and logical deduction are all equally important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day.

Tips: To complete the objective: During the Team Buiding phase, you should analyze, discuss with other players and use your vote on team proposals correctly. You should strongly consider rejecting the proposal if you aren't confident of every one on the proposed Team unless you're on the Evil team. Watch who approves, and ask them why they approved. Evil players can also watch votes to find out who is Merlin. During the Quest phase, you need to reason carefully about the rols of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players. Only give the player's name when making a voting, and don't generate other players' conversation. Reasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.
